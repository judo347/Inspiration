Ideas for future projects (MAYBE)

## Discord: A Status Bot ##
A bot start reads the chat, and on "/afk" eller "/bk" skal den tilføje folk til en afk liste og fjerne dem hvis de er afk og skriver. Brugere skal kunne skrive "/status" og få vist om folk er afk eller online :)

## PoE: Trade history ## 
[ [Link to repositories](https://github.com/judo347/Small_Projects/tree/master/PoE-%20Trade%20History) ](Current Status: Base is done but needs improvement!)

Make a program that can take the input "@IgnatSilik Hi, I would like to buy your A Forest of False Idols listed for 14 chaos in Standard" and split + save to file for later use.
Creating a txt-file that contains my trade history... so every time i buy or sell, i will paste det whisper into my program and it will save the deal. This helps me value the items when i sell them at a later date.

Chaos recipe window:
Window that is clickable and can count the number of items i have for the recipe.

Some type of calender where i am the master.
